Communicate Data Findings 

Project 5 - Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree

The Dataset chosen for this project is the FordGoBike System Dataset. Ford GoBike is a regional public bike sharing system in the San Francisco Bay Area, California. Bay Wheels is the first regional and large-scale bicycle sharing system deployed in California and on the West Coast of the United States with nearly 500,000 rides since the launch in 2017 and had about 10,000 annual subscribers as of January 2018. The dataset used for this exploratory analysis consists of monthly individual trip data from January 2018 to December 2018 in CSV format covering the greater San Francisco Bay area, also available here. This is the Bay Area’s bikeshare system. With thousands of bikes available, it’s the most fun, convenient, and affordable way to explore the region.


There are two reasons for creating visuals using data:
Exploratory analysis is done when you are searching for insights. These visualizations don't need to be perfect. You are using plots to find insights, but they don't need to be aesthetically appealing. You are the consumer of these plots, and you need to be able to find the answer to your questions from these plots.

Explanatory analysis is done when you are providing your results for others. These visualizations need to provide you the emphasis necessary to convey your message. They should be accurate, insightful, and visually appealing.

SUMMARY:
1) Between the User types, Customers and Subscribers the highest usage in terms of duration was by Customers in the year 2017
2) Majority of the system’s bookings came through their app bookings – Lyft
3) The station that received the highest demand in the year 2017 was the station 58 which as the Market St at 10th Street.
However, after cleaning the data and removing all the bookings that were made through non-traditional booking methods which is app and dipper, the station with the highest demand was the station 296, which is 5th St at Virginia Street.
4) The Station 296, the highest demand was on Tuesdays followed by Thursdays. The least demand was on Sundays.
5) The User type who used this station the most were the Subscribers

There was a lot more subscribers using the bike sharing system than casual customers. Obviously different usage patterns are observed between the two types of riders. Subscribers used the system heavily on work days concentrated around 8-9 AM and 17-18 PM for work, whereas customers ride a lot over weekends and in the afternoon for leisure/touring purposes. Subscribers tended to have much shorter/quicker trips compared to customers which makes subscriber usage more efficient.

INSIGHTS:

Different usage pattern is shown between two riders types in the dataset. Subscribers use the system heavily on work days Where customers ride more on weekends, Customers tend to use more in the late afternoon. The shortest period of usage for subscribers corresponds to their grouping in the rush hours Monday till Friday, indicating the use is primarily for work commute. The more shown pattern of customer use shows that they're taking advantage of the bike sharing system quite different from the subscribers, more in weekends and in the afternoon!
